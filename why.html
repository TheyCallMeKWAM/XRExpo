            <ul>
                <li>We find VR so interesting, seeing how far the gaming industry has come and evolved to</li>
                <li>Being able to experience what itâ€™s like being in the shoes of your player or game in general is so surreal and a whole different experience</li>
                <li>The thought of being able to put on a VR headset and not have to leave the house or stare at the screen from a distance and ideally be anywhere you want in the world at any given time from the comfort of your home is just mind blowing</li>
                <li>Ability to render and test any real life experience in a virtual world, ie) training programs</li>
            </ul>
